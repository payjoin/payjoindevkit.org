Commercial attempts to solve Bitcoin’s privacy have faced tremendous barriers. Short-term profit motives have delivered partial and temporary solutions, but transacting privately on Bitcoin remains a challenge.

We formed Payjoin Foundation to pursue the long-term mission of addressing Bitcoin’s privacy problems. Our non-profit exists to develop open-source protocols that align economic incentives with network-wide privacy protection. We believe that users have a right to choose whether or not to reveal their on-chain activity, and that such protocols can even offer a more convenient and delightful experience than those that don't respect this choice.

We are fortunate to have been graced by dozens of volunteer contributors with thousands of commits to our open-source Payjoin Dev Kit software stack. The Payjoin Foundation enables us to recruit and fund talent aligned with our mission. [Armin Sabouri](https://github.com/arminsabouri) and [Spacebear](https://github.com/spacebear21) will continue to lead contributors in research and development. [Satsie](https://satsie.dev) of The Bitcoin Dev Project, Justin of Localhost Research, and myself are serving as the inaugural board.

Initial funding is graciously provided to us by [OpenSats](https://opensats.org/blog/elevent-wave-of-bitcoin-grants). Our gratitude goes out to those supporters and contributors without which this organization would not be possible. Thank you.
